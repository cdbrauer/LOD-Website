            <p>We are so excited to welcome you back to in-person worship services at Light of the Desert!</p>
            <p>Our gatherings will continue to be welcoming and friendly, but we’ll be taking some extra precautions to ensure that our LOD family stays safe. </p>

            <h5>Health & Safety</h5>
            <p>To help ensure the safety of those around you, please <a href="../stream/index.html">join us online</a> and do not come to in-person worship if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feel sick or have had a fever in the past 24 hours</li>
                <li>Have had contact with someone who has COVID-19</li>
                <li>Have any underlying health conditions</li>
                <li>Consider yourself to be a vulnerable or “at-risk” part of the population</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Children</h5>
            <p>Children are to stay with their families during the first part of the service. After the music and before the message, children Pre-K to 5th grade will be dismissed to their Sunday School classes. There will be no Nursery at this time, but we will have a “cry room” available in the lobby where parents can watch the service on a TV monitor.</p>

            <h5>Reservations</h5>
            <p>Please reserve a space below for each person who will be attending the worship service with you.</p>

            <blockquote class="fine-print">* We strongly recommend you wear a mask when you attend in-person worship. If you do not wear a mask, we will assume you have a health condition that prevents you from wearing a mask but we will not ask you about your health condition.</blockquote>
